package collections.map.hashmap;

//A HashMap stores items in key/value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value.
/*


It is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface.

Instead of accessing elements by an index (like with ArrayList), you use a key to retrieve its associated value.

A HashMap can store many different combinations, such as:

String keys and Integer values
String keys and String values
