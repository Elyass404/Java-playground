abstract class AbstarctMethod{

    //an abstract method is a method that has no body, just the name and type, and if you want parametres 

    //an abstact method should be inside an abstract class, you can not put an abstract method inside a normal class 
    //think of it like this, since you will change the body of the method in another class, so that class will be inheriting
    //the class that includes the abstract method, and to inherite a class it should be abstract, and that is why you should 
    //put an abstract method only in an abstract class

    public abstract void showSomething(); //this is the abstract class 
}
